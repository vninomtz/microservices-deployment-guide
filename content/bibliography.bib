  abstract = {Distributed systems have become more fine-grained in the past 10 years, shifting from code-heavy monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices. But developing these systems brings its own set of headaches. With lots of examples and practical advice, this book takes a holistic view of the topics that system architects and administrators must consider when building, managing, and evolving microservice architectures.Microservice technologies are moving quickly. Author Sam Newman provides you with a firm grounding in the concepts while diving into current solutions for modeling, integrating, testing, deploying, and monitoring your own autonomous services. You'll follow a fictional company throughout the book to learn how building a microservice architecture affects a single domain.Discover how microservices allow you to align your system design with your organization's goalsLearn options for integrating a service with the rest of your systemTake an incremental approach when splitting monolithic codebasesDeploy individual microservices through continuous integrationExamine the complexities of testing and monitoring distributed servicesManage security with user-to-service and service-to-service modelsUnderstand the challenges of scaling microservice architectures},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of software architecture approaches that support the implementation of Continuous Delivery (CD) and DevOps. Its goal is to provide an understanding of the state-of-the-art on the topic, which is informative for both researchers and practitioners. We found 17 characteristics of a software architecture that are beneficial for CD and DevOps adoption and identified ten potential software architecture obstacles in adopting CD and DevOps in the case of an existing software system. Moreover, our review indicated that micro-services are a dominant architectural style in this context. Our literature review has some implications: for researchers, it provides a map of the recent research efforts on software architecture in the CD and DevOps domain. For practitioners, it describes a set of software architecture principles that possibly can guide the process of creating or adapting software systems to fit in the CD and DevOps context.},
